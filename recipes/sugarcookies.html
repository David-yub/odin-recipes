        <h3>Description:</h3>
        <p>Quick and easy sugar cookies! They are really good, plain or with candies in them. My friend uses chocolate mints on
        top, and they're great!</p>
        <h3>ingredients</h3>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>2 ¾ cups all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
                <li>½ teaspoon baking powder</li>
                <li>1 cup butter, softened</li>
                <li>1 ½ cups white sugar</li>
                <li>1 egg</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h3>Steps:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). In a small bowl, stir together flour, baking soda, and baking powder. Set
            aside.</li>
            <li>In a large bowl, cream together the butter and sugar until smooth. Beat in egg and vanilla. Gradually blend in the dry
